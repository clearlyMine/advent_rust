Once parsed it was fairly straight forward in Part 1. Part 2: This was tricky and I'm quite proud of what I was able to program |

Only thing that tripped me was not using .trim() on the input as it contained a return(\n) at the end. Part 2: That was one verbose explanation for a fairly simple problem. Only thing that I misread was the HASH algorithm was to be run only on the label and not the whole string. |

Part 2: I figured out that there has to be a cycle but it took me a substantial amount of time to figure out how to manage the cache. |

For part 2 at first I tried actually increasing the grid size instead of using math, then came up with the math based solution. |

*Remarks are for the very first solution through which I got the answer that I submitted, the latest code will be different as I keep optimizing the solutions.

### To run a particular day
```bash 
mkdir inputs
cd inputs
```
a separate file needs to be provided for each day in the format dayxx.txt
```bash 
touch dayxx.txt
```
Open the file in your favourite editor and paste your puzzle input inside the file
```bash
cargo run --release --bin dayxx
```
(make sure to change the day number)
<br>
### To run all the days at once
make sure that all the puzzle inputs are present
```bash
cargo run --release
```
