# Performance
| Day | Time (Part 1) | Rank (Part 1) | Time (Part 2) | Rank (Part 2) | Remarks* |
|----:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|---------|
| [18](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day16.rs)  | 02:07:09      | 5,527         | 04:24:51      | 4,822         | This was a tough one, I brute-forced Part 1 and for Part 2 tried multiple different approaches but in the end I had to go back to day 10 and figure out the implementation of Shoelace for this one. |
| [16](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day16.rs)  | 01:21:15      | 4,642         | 01:37:55      | 4,455         | The question wasn't too hard, figured it would be a recursively done program from the start, it took me long to get all the cases correct and correctly determine the cache. |
| [15](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day15.rs)  | 00:14:20      | 4,729         | 00:50:05      | 4,305         | Part 1: Kinda disappointed by how long it took me. Only thing that tripped me was not using .trim() on the input as it contained a return(\n) at the end. Part 2: That was one verbose explanation for a fairly simple problem. Only thing that I misread was the HASH algorithm was to be run only on the label and not the whole string. |
| [14](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day14.rs)  | 00:19:56      | 3,202         | 01:42:53      | 4,265         | Part 1 was fairly simple and I just used math instead of modifying the grid. Part 2: I figured out that there has to be a cycle but it took me a substantial amount of time to figure out how to manage the cache. |
| [13](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day13.rs)  | 02:16:01      | 7,732         | 02:46:52      | 6,380         | Naively assumed that only one end will have to be ignored (which works for the sample) and wasted a long time in trying to get the correct solution for the input. |
| [12](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day12.rs)  | 01:04:34      | 4,471         | 07:24:32      | 6,309         | WTF even is dynamic programming ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ |
| [11](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day11.rs)  | 01:07:32      | 7,555         | 01:28:59      | 7,108         | Copied the corrected sample and wasted a very long time trying to get the correct answer. For part 2 at first I tried actually increasing the grid size instead of using math, then came up with the math based solution. |
| [10](https://github.com/clearlyMine/advent_rust/blob/main/year_2023/src/bin/day10.rs)  | 01:10:58      | 5,040         | 06:04:34      | 7,878         | Part 2 was rough, even after figuring out that shoelace algorithm could be used I wasted way too long in coming up with another kind of solution. |

*Remarks are for the very first solution through which I got the answer that I submitted, the latest code will be different as I keep optimizing the solutions.

### To run a particular day
```bash 
mkdir inputs
cd inputs
```
a separate file needs to be provided for each day in the format dayxx.txt
```bash 
touch dayxx.txt
```
Open the file in your favourite editor and paste your puzzle input inside the file
```bash
cargo run --release --bin dayxx
```
(make sure to change the day number)
<br>
### To run all the days at once
make sure that all the puzzle inputs are present
```bash
cargo run --release
```
